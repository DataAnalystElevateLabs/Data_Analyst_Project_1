Project 1: Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Prediction
Objective:

To predict the Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) of customers using machine learning techniques, enabling the company to identify high-value customers, personalize marketing strategies, and improve long-term profitability.

Steps Followed:

Problem Understanding and Data Exploration:

Understood that the goal was to estimate the future value a customer brings to the business.

Loaded and explored customer transaction data, including features such as Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value, Days_Since_Last_Purchase, and demographic details.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handled missing values using central tendency measures (mean/median) and treated outliers through winsorization.

Converted categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding and standardized numeric variables for uniform scaling.

Feature Engineering:

Created key behavioral metrics like:

Recency – Days since the last purchase.

Frequency – Number of transactions made.

Monetary Value – Total revenue generated by a customer.

Performed log transformation on skewed features to normalize distributions.

Data Splitting and Model Building:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.

Implemented XGBoost Regressor to predict LTV, tuning hyperparameters such as learning_rate, max_depth, and n_estimators for optimal performance.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluated model accuracy using RMSE, MAE, and R² score.

Compared training and testing performance to ensure no overfitting.

Customer Segmentation:

Used predicted y_pred values to segment customers into groups such as:

High LTV

Medium LTV

Low LTV

Applied K-Means Clustering on normalized predicted values to identify meaningful segments based on LTV distribution.

Insights and Interpretation:

High-LTV customers showed high frequency and recent engagement patterns.

Low-LTV customers displayed longer inactivity periods and fewer transactions.

Recommended retention campaigns and loyalty programs for high-LTV customers.

Outcome:

Built a data-driven model to predict customer LTV with strong accuracy.

Enabled strategic segmentation for marketing and resource allocation, enhancing customer relationship management.

Step 1: Data Cleaning and Transformation
This foundational phase ensures your dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

Handled missing values and corrected inconsistent entries

Imputed or removed nulls in key fields like Customer Name, Product ID, or Sales.

Standardized inconsistent category names (e.g., “Office Supplies” vs. “office supplies”) to ensure grouping accuracy.

Validated numerical fields (e.g., negative sales or discounts >100%) to prevent skewed metrics.

Converted order and ship dates to standard formats

Parsed date fields into datetime format for time-series analysis.

Created derived columns like Order Month, Order Year, and Week Number for temporal slicing.

Created calculated columns

Profit Margin = (Profit / Sales) * 100 to assess product-level profitability.

Discount Percentage = (Discount / Sales) * 100 to evaluate discounting strategy.

Days to Ship = Ship Date - Order Date to measure fulfillment efficiency.
 
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This phase uncovers patterns, anomalies, and business insights hidden in the data.

Identified trends in sales volume, profitability, and discount impact

Analyzed sales and profit over time to detect growth or decline.

Correlated discount levels with profit margins to assess whether discounts are driving volume or eroding profit.

Detected seasonal fluctuations and monthly revenue growth

Used line charts and heatmaps to visualize sales peaks (e.g., Q4 holiday spikes).

Calculated MoM and YoY growth rates to track performance momentum.

Segmented customers based on purchasing behavior and frequency

Applied RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) logic to classify customers into tiers (e.g., loyal, at-risk, high-value).

Identified top customer segments by revenue contribution and order frequency.

Step 3: Visualization and Dashboard Creation
This is where your insights become actionable through intuitive, interactive visuals.

Created interactive dashboards in Power BI with dynamic filters

Enabled users to slice data by:

Category: Compare performance across Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology.

Region: Drill into East, West, Central, and South zones.

Salesperson: Evaluate individual contributions and targets.

Customer Segment: Analyze trends across Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office.

Developed high-impact visuals

Top 10 Products: Bar chart showing bestsellers by revenue or profit.

Regional Sales Growth: Line or area chart tracking sales trends by region over time.

Profit Distribution: Box plots or scatter plots to highlight outliers and skewness in profitability.

Project 3: Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
Objective:

To build a classification model that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn, helping the company take proactive steps to retain valuable customers.

Steps Followed:

Understanding the Business Problem:

The goal was to predict customer churn — whether a customer will continue or discontinue telecom services.

Identified key drivers like customer tenure, service usage, contract type, and monthly charges.

Data Cleaning and Exploration:

Checked for missing values, incorrect data types, and duplicates.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns such as higher churn among short-tenure or high-charge customers.

Feature Engineering and Encoding:

Encoded categorical variables (like contract type, internet service) using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.

Normalized continuous features to bring them to a comparable scale.

Created additional derived metrics such as “total charges per tenure” to capture spending consistency.

Model Building:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Trained multiple models — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost Classifier.

Selected the XGBoost Classifier as the final model for its superior predictive performance.

Model Evaluation:

Used metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

Plotted the ROC-AUC Curve to measure model discrimination power.

Ensured balance between sensitivity (detecting churners) and specificity (retaining non-churners).

Churn Segmentation and Insights:

Identified customer clusters with higher churn probability.

Found that customers with month-to-month contracts and high monthly charges were more likely to churn.

Suggested retention strategies like discounts, personalized offers, and better customer support.

Outcome:

Developed a predictive churn model with strong accuracy and interpretability.

Helped business teams target at-risk customers proactively, improving customer retention rates and reducing churn-related losses.
